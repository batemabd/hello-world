# hello-world

Hello! My name is Bethany Bateman McDonald. I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Hispanic Linguistics and Instructor of Record at the University of Georgia. My dissertation project examines use of the simple and compound past by monolingual and bilingual speakers of Andean Spanish in Cusco, Peru.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband and (NEW!) son, improving my skills in the kitchen, and finding ways to stay involved in the community.
